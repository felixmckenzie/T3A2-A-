### Projectable Description 
**Purpose:**

Visual representation is vital when planning a project in a team setting as it conveys high level information to those involved. A kanban board is an effective tool for workflow visualization which can  help teams plan and execute a project through clearly defining tasks and limiting work in progress. Projectable is a lightweight, project management application that helps teams, of any size and type, collaborate and track the progress of their work through kanban style project boards.

While several project management tools exist on the market, many have been met with criticism from their users. Existing tools such as Jira, are feature rich, however can be complicated to use, with unintuitive workflows and slow load times, and most importantly no dark mode! 

Simpler alternatives, such as Trello and Asana, provide a lower barrier to entry, however are capped by a paywall once you reach their free tier limit. Projectable is a free, open source alternative that puts user experience first. 

**Features/Functionality:**

- Register and Login via firebase authentication 
- Toggle light and dark mode 
- Create and manage project boards 
- Collaborate with team members on projects
- Provide feedback to team members through comments
