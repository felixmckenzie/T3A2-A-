## Projectable Description 
**Purpose:**

Visual representation is vital when planning a project in a team setting as it conveys high level information to all involved. A Project Manager is responsible for taking a project from ideation to completion, and navigating the team through every step and problem in-between. Many Project Managers are faced with new challenges in today's post-pandemic world, now trying to lead their teams and projects through a completely remote, work-from-home environment. Moreover, it seems remote work is here to stay: 74% of professionals expect remote work to become standard, with 97% not wanting to return to the office full-time. 
How can teams achieve the same level of success in a distributed workforce? 

Task management and communication is central to the success of any Project Manager and team. Projects are made up of dozens of tasks each with their own level of difficulty and time requirements. 77% of high-performing projects use project management software, yet only 22% of organizations actually make the investment.

Existing tools such as Jira are feature rich, however can be complicated to use, with unintuitive workflows and slow load times, and most importantly no dark mode.
