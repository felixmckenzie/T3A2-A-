### Projectable Description 
**Purpose**
Projectable is a lightweight, project management application that helps teams, of any size and type, collaborate and track the progress of their work. While several project management tools exist on the market, many have been met with criticism from their users. Existing tools such as Jira, are feature rich, however can be complicated to use, with unintuitive workflows and slow load times, and most importantly no dark mode! 

Simpler alternatives, such as Trello and Asana, provide a lower barrier to entry, however are capped by a paywall once you reach their free tier limit. Projectable is a free, open source alternative that puts user experience first.
